# pats-note-taker

## Description

  - A web application that allows you to save notes anywhere.
  - I was motivated to build this tool so I could demonstrate a server using Express.js.
  - It is nice to be able to write and save notes from your computer or phone so you dont' have to use paper.
  - If you ever have an idea or a to-do list and you don't have any paper or a pen you can use this tool because you probably always have your phone with you.
  - I learned Express.js and how to deploy to heroku.
