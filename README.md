# pats-note-taker

## Description

  - A web application that allows you to save notes from anywhere.
  - I was motivated to build this tool so I could jot down any notes i think about during the day. This app makes it very easy to save my notes and to delete notes I no longer need.
  - It is nice to be able to save notes online instead of writing them on paper or on my phone. If I want anyone else to see the notes it is very easy as they can go the URL.
  - If you ever have an idea or a to-do list and you don't have any paper or a pen you can use this tool because you probably always have your phone with you.
  - I learned Express.js and how to deploy to heroku. I also learned how to use the DELETE method to remove notes. I chose to add a deleted flag to notes that are deleted instead of removing them from the json file. This solves the numbering problem as there are no gaps in note IDs. Also if you ever wanted to restore a note the data is still there.
